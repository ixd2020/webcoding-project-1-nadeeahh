            David Hockney has painted several still life paintings of flowers
            that are dedicated to the passing of his closest friends and
            including those who are unwell. As seen in the painting, the wilting
            sunflowers represent his friends who are ill. Though it has a sad
            meaning, Hockney uses vibrant colours to add a positive feeling in
            order to mask the sadness he was going through. This painting was
            displayed with his other flower paintings at an exhibition called
            “Flowers, Faces and Spaces” at Annely Juda Fine Art in London in
            1997.

            In 1964, David Hockney moved to California and he was drawn to the
            hot climate and the bright and relaxed environment. He became
            inspired to paint one of his most well-known paintings, “A bigger
            splash” along with his other swimming pool paintings between 1964
            and 1971 which he explored painting the changing surface of water.
            He uses a suitable medium and bright colours to depict California’s
            hot climate. The splash he painted was based on a photograph and he
            was amazed how the splash that lasts for only a few seconds can be
            captured on a photograph. During this period, Hockney was obsessed
            with painting pools.

            Did you know that this was the most expensive painting to ever be
            sold at an auction? This painting was sold for $90.3 million in 2018
            to an unknown buyer. It is Hockney’s most renowned painting and it
            was painted after his emotional breakup in 1971 with Peter
            Schlesinger, who is the man standing in the painting. The painting
            tells an emotional story of his breakup with Peter and it shows the
            tension between the two figures where Peter is closing his eyes and
            looking downwards while Hockney, the man in the pool is unable to
            see or hear anything which shows the disconnection between the two.

            This piece was completed in 1968 of a couple who are avid art
            collectors at their Los Angeles home. Interestingly, the painting
            has a subtle humour because of how they seem to mirror the statues
            at their home and how far apart they are standing from one another
            whilst looking serious. In this collection, he explored many styles,
            mainly lines and creating balance and symmetry with the placement of
            the statues.

            The painting features two of Hockney’s friends, a fashion designer
            Ossie Clark and his wife who is a textile designer, Celia Birtwell
            in their flat shortly after their wedding. The painting foreshadows
            their failed marriage where Celia can be seen standing while Clark
            was sitting which was unconventional of a wedding portrait. Some
            symbolism in his paintings are the lilies which represent feminine
            purity while the cat on Clark’s lap represents someone who does what
            they please. The open window with the sunlight separating the two
            foreshadows their divorce afterwards.

              Despite his age, David Hockney is keeping up with technology and
              is very skilled in painting on his Ipad. He has always been
              interested in technology and he first started experimenting
              digitally in 1985 with an early computer programme before moving
              on to paint on Iphone and the Ipad. He mainly drew his
              surroundings, landscapes and nature as seen in the photos above.
              He then came up with a book titled, “My Window” which is a
              collection of his paintings done on the Iphone and Ipad.
