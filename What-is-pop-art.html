                Pop art is an art movement that originated from Britain in the
                1950s and eventually made its way to the United States in the
                1960s. The word ‘Pop Art’ was derived from the word ‘Popular
                Culture’. Artists such as Eduardo Palouzzi and Richard Hamilton
                were the first ones who founded Pop Art. This art movement
                became prevalent in the 20th century because it combines fine
                art and imagery which has a modern feel to the artworks. The art
                style stood out as artists take inspiration from the media such
                as advertisements, icons, comics and everyday items for the mass
                audience. Some of the most famous Pop Art artists today are Andy
                Warhol, Keith Haring including David Hockney which many of their
                artworks have influenced the Pop Art culture today.
