      <p class="heading_sentence" style="font-family: ''Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">"Pop art is an art movement that originated from Britain in the 1950s and eventually made its way to the United States in the 1960s. The word ‘Pop Art’ was derived from the word ‘Popular Culture’. Artists such as Eduardo Palouzzi and Richard Hamilton were the first ones who founded Pop Art. This art movement became prevalent in the 20th century because it combines fine art and imagery which has a modern feel to the artworks. The art style stood out as artists take inspiration from the media such as advertisements, icons, comics and everyday items for the mass audience. Some of the most famous Pop Art artists today are Andy Warhol, Keith Harring including David Hockney which many of their artworks have influenced the Pop Art culture today.</p>
