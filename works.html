      "30 Sunflowers"</h3>David Hockney has painted several still life paintings of flowers that are dedicated to the passing of his closest friends and including those who are unwell. As seen in the painting, the wilting sunflowers represent his friends who are ill. Though it has a sad meaning, Hockney uses vibrant colours to add a positive feeling in order to mask the sadness he was going through.
    This painting was displayed with his other flower paintings at an exhibition called “Flowers, Faces and Spaces” at Annely Juda Fine Art in London in 1997.
