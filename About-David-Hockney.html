            David Hockney is a British modern painter who was born on 9 July
            1937, in Bradford. His versatility is admired because he not only
            paints, but he is also a stage designer, photographer and a
            printmaker. While he was in school, Hockney’s interest in art
            developed at the age of 11 and knew that he wanted to pursue his
            life as an artist. In 1953-57, he followed his dream and studied at
            the Bradford School of Art where he specialized in lithography and
            painting. Today, Hockney remained as one of the Pop Artists’ that is
            the most influential in the 20th century and also someone who made a
            big impact on the Pop Art movement because of his colourful
            expressive paintings and portraits. Some artists his art style was
            influenced by were Wallace Stevens, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.
            He loves painting landscapes, nature and people he loves in his
            artwork. Most of his paintings exhibit naturalism style and the
            vibrant colours he uses gives off a tranquil and modern feeling.
            Till today, Hockney is still painting and experimenting with
            different styles in his art.
